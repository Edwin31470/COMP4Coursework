		2  & Check searching the database is working correctly & Bottom-up testing  & Components will be tested as they are developed \\ \hline
		3  & Check data is inserted into the database in the right locations & Bottom-up testing  & Components will be tested as they are developed \\ \hline
		4  & Check buttons and flow of control work as intented & Top-down testing  & Components will be tested when the program is finished to check buttons still retain their functionality \\ \hline
