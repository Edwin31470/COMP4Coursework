\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach to Testing}
I utilised both bottom-up and top-down testing techniques. I used bottom-up testing to test individual functions of the program such as entering data into a field as the rest of the program does not affect that function. I used top-down testing for testing for testing whole areas of the program such as making sure buttons function correctly as these use multiple areas of the program.

\subsection{Problems Encountered}

\underline{Series 8.11 and 8.21} \\
I have discovered a huge error with my program, being that when a field is double clicked from anywhere, including the Display Member and Edit Member, it is deleted without warning. This is problamatic as data could easily be accidently deleted as the user is more likely to be careful when they know they need to double click to delete, and data should not be able to be deleted from those locations. This is easily fixable by adding an if statment to ensure that the current screen is either the Delete Member or Delete Parent window before deleting the data.  As additional layers of protection I could easily make a pop-up window appear for the user to decide whether they are sure they want to delete that field before the data is actually deleted.

\underline{Series 1.14, 1.24, 2.14 and 2.24} \\
Spaces could be used in the first and last name field, where they should not be allowed. Easily fixable by not including spaces in the regular expression.

\underline{Series 6.11} \\
Pop-up window are resizable when they should not be. Easily fixable by setting the resizable attribute of the windows to false.

\underline{Series 2.70 2.72} \\
Incorrect email address are displayed as amber (unfinished) when they should be displayed as incorrect (red). Work needs to be done on the regular expression and the if statements.

\subsection{Strengths of Testing}
I believe bottom-up testing to be stronger than top-down testing due to its effiecency and the speed at which testing can be got through, and if features are even just lightly tested as they are created many bugs can be fixed before going into the main testing phase, and the intricacies of the code currently being worked on are stil fresh in the coder's mind

\subsection{Weaknesses of Testing}
If I had included every possible character in my testing of validation of data to be entered then I would have spent a substantial amount of time entering every possible unicode character into each field.

\subsection{Reliability of Application}
My testing has ensured that whenever data is added into the database the user is at least alerted that the data is likely invalid. 

\subsection{Robustness of Application}
Little of my testing has been to test if there are things happening that should not be happening, for example the problem faced in series 8.11 and 8.21. I have however tested all buttons to make sure they are functioning correctly. The way that I have gone about deleting data from the database is not very robust as errors will often appear in the console although they are not visible to the user.
