\section{Environment}

\subsection{Software}
The software and modules I used to implement the program:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python 3
	\item IDLE
	\item PyQt 4
	\item SQLite3
	\item Notepad++
	\item SQLiteInspecter
	\item 
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage Explanation}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Software}   & \textbf{Explaination for use of software} \\ \hline
		Python 3 & I know this language well and python is a relatively powerful language. Python allows bug finding and fixing to be incredibly easy as the program can be compiled quickly as you write it instead of using a seperate compiler. Python is free and is object orientated. \\ \hline
		IDLE &  I used this python environment as it comes with the basic installtion of python and is the only editor installed on school computers.
		PyQt4 & PyQt allows for the easy creation of a GUI
		SQLite3 & Used for database creation and editing as I have been taught this and SQL allows for easy database manipulation
		Notepad++ & Used for the creation of HTML files as I know how to use it and HTML files can be run from the program
		SQLiteInspector & I used this program that my teacher created to test SQL queries and to check data is added to the database properly.

\subsection{Features Used}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|l}
		\hline
		\textbf{Software}   & \textbf{Features used} \\ \hline
		Python 3 & Python allowed me to create a basic CLI program to make sure my logic and usability was good before creating a GUI program. Python is object orientated and has many modules pre-installed.\\ \hline
		IDLE &  IDLE displays python code in colour showining where mistakes have been made and makes it easier to code. Allows the program to be run and compiled easily.
		PyQt4 & PyQt is easy to install
		SQLite3 & Used for database creation and editing as I have been taught this and SQL allows for easy database manipulation
		Notepad++ & Used for the creation of HTML files as I know how to use it and HTML files can be run from the program
		SQLiteInspector & Viewing databases and

\section{System Overview}

%use as many subsections as necessary for the system components
\subsection{Logging in}
The login screen has the purpose of protecting sensitive data and adding an extra layer of security. The user must supply a username and a password, both of which are stored on an encrypted file 

\section{Code Structure}

%use as many subsections as necessary for the code sections
